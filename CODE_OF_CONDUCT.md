# Code of Conduct
This is not a legal document.

We as members of, contributors to, and leaders of this project pledge to
strive to be respectful and responsible, and to give and take constructive
feedback where applicable.

We also pledge to not engage in conduct which could reasonably be considered
as harassing or demeaning to others, in channels or capacities officially
associated with this project or in ways where this project is the clear
connecting factor, such as when privately contacting someone whom they only
know through this project. Examples of unacceptable behavior include but
is not limited to sexualized language, making derogatory comments on others
based on personal or group characteristics, making unwanted advances,
publishing others' private information without permission, and other
conduct which would be illegal or could reasonably be considered
inappropriate in a professional setting.

Instances of unacceptable behavior in official channels or capacities may
be reported by anyone to project leaders at [abuse@chiralsymmetry.com](mailto:abuse@chiralsymmetry.com). Project
leaders pledge to review and respond to accusations in a fair and timely
manner, while respecting accusers privacy and security. Project leaders
reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject any contributions considered
to go against this Code of Conduct.

Expected disciplinary actions depend on severity and frequency of the
behavior, or on the number of repeated offenses, but the primary action is
a privately conveyed correction, the secondary action is a warning with a
temporary ban on any interaction with concerned persons, the tertiary action
is a time-limited ban on any involvement with the project, including any
interaction with project related persons, and the final action is a
time-unlimited ban on any further involvement with the project.
