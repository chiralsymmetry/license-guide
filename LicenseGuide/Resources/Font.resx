    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The Creative Commons family of public copyright licenses has the primary goal of promoting free culture and open content. That’s why they have developed several licenses with careful legal language and varying terms and conditions, to allow creators who want to contribute to choose a license that suits their needs.

By licensing/marking your font as CC0, you indicate your intention to permanently waive all copyright, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without any requirement for compensation or attribution. (Please note that the license applies only to copyright, not to trademarks or patents.)

Please note that the choice of license should be considered final and irrevocable. An author who releases his or her font under CC0 should expect such a release to be considered final and irrevocable; the author may create new or modified fonts with different terms or licenses, but should assume that old fonts are always covered by their freest terms. On the other hand, an author who releases a font under stricter terms/licenses may release the font at any time, even retroactively (i.e. previously created and modified fonts). It may therefore be better to start strictly and open up, rather than the other way around.</value>

    <value>For full control, you should rely on the copyright that applies by default to all works that reach the threshold of originality. Almost all countries have signed agreements to enforce copyright laws with certain minimum protections, and to respect copyright in each other’s countries. A creator of a work, such as a font, automatically has at least 50 years of exclusive economic and moral rights to determine how the work is copied and distributed, provided it is sufficiently original.

Normal copyright applies even in the absence of a copyright notice, e.g. if you publish your font online without ever writing that you prohibit its use, copying or distribution. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to be explicit to avoid misunderstandings, if only because fonts are often freely available online.

Any individual or organization that wants to use your font legally must negotiate for your permission, usually through a written agreement. Please note that an author with full rights can offer his reserved font under freer terms or licenses at any time, even retroactively (i.e. previously created and modified fonts). However, such a release should be considered final and irrevocable: an author may subsequently release new or modified fonts under a different license, but should assume that old fonts are always covered by their freest terms.</value>

    <value>The Open Font License, or OFL, is a font license created by the language research organization SIL, intended to be ideologically compatible with the GPL license of the software world: the user of an OFL-licensed font shall have the right to use the font for any purpose and to modify the font as needed, but if modified must distribute the font with improvements under the same license (OFL 1.1).

If the OFL is inappropriate, you can use the license guide for other material and choose a Creative Commons license. Note, however, that a “No Derivatives” license (i.e. a prohibition on creating works based on your work) may be inappropriate if the intent is only to prohibit modification of font files, as it could also prohibit normal use of fonts.</value>

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

    <value>If you want to allow free distribution and use — i.e. things like using the font in printed material — and distribution, but prohibit modification, the only option in the absence of suitable ready-made licenses may be a custom-written license, even though it may be difficult to express the terms in a way that both legally secures your intentions, and is sufficiently easy for users to understand. Below is a proposal intended to allow private and commercial use and distribution, but prohibit modification.
