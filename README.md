# License Guide
License Guide is an opiniated helper for picking an appropriate license for
source code, font files, or other types of materials. The selection of
licenses is small but safe.

Where other guides approach the issue with positivity, such as “use this
license if you want something simple”, we ask you questions meant to
illustrate worst-case scenarios, in order to minimize the risk of you having to
regret your choice. We may even recommend not using a license at all — after
all, you always have the option of making your work more free later on, but
never the other way around.

To aid in understanding the complexities of copyright, the application
includes an informative “Q and A” section.

⚠️ The information provided by this application is for informational purposes
only and should not be taken as legal advice. Please consult a qualified
attorney for legal advice. ⚠️

## Usage
Download, run, click, read.

## Settings
Settings may be provided through a text file named `appsettings.json`.
Language may be overridden by setting `Language` to a language code, and a
rough ”dark mode” may be activated by setting `Style` to `dark-mode`.

```json
{
  "Language": "en-US",
  "Style": "dark-mode"
}
```

The application may be trivial, but contributions are welcome, such as
feature suggestions, language translations, suggestions on questions to add
to the ”Q and A” section (with answers or not), and critique of the text of
the application.

Pull requests are welcome, but [remember](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) that such contributions will be placed under the same
